This is a repository for Clojure(-Script) specs written using the link:https://github.com/gnl/ghostwheel/blob/master/README.adoc#the-gspec-syntax[Ghostwheel gspec syntax], including link:https://github.com/gnl/ghostwheel.specs/blob/master/src/ghostwheel/specs/clojure/core.cljc[specs for most of clojure.core].

It's the Clojure version of link:https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped[Definitely Typed].

NOTE: They can be used for run- and test-time instrumentation with link:https://clojure.org/guides/spec[`clojure.spec`] to easily catch incorrect function calls in your code by requiring the corresponding `ghostwheel.specs.*` namespace and using Ghostwheel's link:https://github.com/gnl/ghostwheel/blob/master/README.adoc#getting-started[extrumentation feature] or just calling `s/instrument` directly.

WARNING: Instrumenting all of `clojure.core` as a whole is not recommended at this point because things will likely break.

PRs are welcome â€“ please add your spec namespaces to the `contrib` package. Their names should correspond to the namespaces they are speccing, so for example `ghostwheel.contrib.cuerdas.core`. If the library works on both Clojure and ClojureScript, make sure your specs do as well.
